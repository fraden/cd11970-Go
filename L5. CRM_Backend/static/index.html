	<h1>The CRM backend supports the following requests:</h1>
    <ul>
            <li> GET "/customers" to get all customers </li>
            <li> GET "/customers/{id}" to get a specific customer, defined by id</li>
            <li> PUT "/customers/{id}" to update a specific customer, defined by id</li>
            <li> DELETE "/customers/{id}" to delete a specific customer, defined by id</li>
            <li> POST "/customers" to create a new customer. You need to provide the customer data as json body.</li>
    </ul>
    A sample json body for the POST "/customers" request can look like this:
    <pre>
        {
            "name": "Max Mustermann",
            "role": "solution architect",
            "email": "max.mustermann@coolmail.com",
            "phone": "0171/22446688",
            "contacted": false
        }
    </pre>
